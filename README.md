# react-native-common

A personal React Native + React + TypeScript utility library.

This is my stash of all the common code I reuse across projects — from components, functions, constants, types, and more.  
Still under constant changes and improvements. Not really meant for public use, but too lazy to make it private.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-common
```

## Contributing

This is a personal project — contributions aren't expected, but if you really want to, hit me up or open a PR.
